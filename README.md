This lab entails creating the fornt end of a web server to a perviously existing backend code. design and implement a user friendly GUI (graphical user interface) for the tank management application.

This version of the frontend app should act as a mock-up to show what the final application could look like. Consider it a first draft, and should be implemented using HMTL and CSS.

The objective is to design an appropriate card design in HTML. These cards should be designed to display all the attributes of each tank object and the user profile object.The HTML layout of a tank object can as simple or as complex a design as desired, as long as it makes sense. That being said, it should be known that you will not be graded on aesthetics or visual appearance. Full marks will be awarded as long as all requirements are met.

The design displays 4 tank cards.
CSS is used to style the user card and tank cards and the page header.
